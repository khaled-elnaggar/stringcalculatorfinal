First step:
- empty string should return 0
- string with one number returns itself
- string with 2 numbers returns their sum
- returned value has 1 decimal place
- string with more than 2 numbers returns => InvalidInputError “Invalid input, can not add more than 2 numbers”
- input contains non-number => InvalidInputError “Number expected but found non-number“
