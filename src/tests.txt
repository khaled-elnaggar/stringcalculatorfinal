First step:
- empty string should return 0
- string with one number returns itself
- string with 2 numbers returns their sum
- returned value has 1 decimal place
- string with more than 2 numbers returns => InvalidInputError “Invalid input, can not add more than 2 numbers”
- input contains non-number => InvalidInputError “Number expected but found non-number“

Newline as separator:
- string with newline as separator returns the sum
- (',\n' '\n,' ',,') missing number between comma and newline returns = > InvalidInputError "Invalid input, missing number between \\n and ,"
